<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Esseline and I am 22 years old, I’ve lived in Leiden for the past three years and can confidently say that I find it to be one
  of the best and prettiest cities in the Netherlands. My family is predominantly Dutch, but I have some strong Scandinavian and Finnish roots
  and I have family living throughout Europe. Someday I wish to learn Finnish because of my Finnish grandmother, and because I want to learn at least one
  other language. However, I am actually very bad at languages so it will probably be some time before I am moderately okay (which is surprising
  as I’ve studied another language, but until now only English and Dutch have been nice to me).</p>
<p>Languages that I speak fluently:
  <ul>
    <li>Dutch</li>
    <li>English</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td style="width:20%"><i>Prior Knowledge</i><td>I have no previous experience with any ICT related topic. I only have experience in reading
      manuscripts, the history of the book, and the history of the printing press through my BA in English. However, I had planned to go to
      a beginners class of coding in Bath, but due to COVID I had to return to the Netherlands and I missed the class, so in another universe
      I already could have had some basic coding and technical skills.</td>

  <tr>
    <td style="width:20%"><i>Expectations</i><td>I expect to gain good skills in coding and more knowledge of the history of the book and of the current
      state of the printing business. I hope that the experiences and courses this MA offers will help find me a future career path.</td>
