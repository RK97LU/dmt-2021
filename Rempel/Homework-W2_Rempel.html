  <p>Hello! I'm a Canadian Academic Librarian on sabbatical for a year to participate in the Book & Digital Media Studies Program. I have been working at Athabasca University for the past six years, and prior to that worked in Astana (Nursultan), Kazakhstan, and Prince George, BC, Canada. I have graduate degrees in Library and Information Studies, and in English Literature, from the <a href= "https://www.ubc.ca/ "> University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC</a>.
</p>
  <p>I love to travel and experience new things! I'm loving life in Leiden so far, and am looking forward to getting to know more about Dutch culture - I hope to learn to speak Dutch as well!</p>
